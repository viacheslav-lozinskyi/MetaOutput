# What is MetaOutput?
*********************

This is plugin for Visual Studio, which allows to ignore standard output tool.


# Why MetaOutput was created?
****************************

Development of standard output tool is frozen and its current functionality is pretty limited.
Lack of improvements is reason why I decided to solve this problem.


# How to install:
*****************

From the installer:
	Just follow the install wizard.

From the Visual Studio:
	Just find extension "MetaOutput" in Visual Studio Extension Manager and install it.
