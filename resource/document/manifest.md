# MetaProject Community Manifest


### INTRODUCTION

MetaProject was created to make the work of programmers easier and more efficient.
Functionality of the program has already been improved and continues to improve.

As result, large number of users appeared and now I have lot of communications, inspiring and disappointing.

I thanks to everyone for that.
Even to those who did not appreciate results of my work.

As before, I will answer to all comments and all requests.
I will also respond as quickly as possible to any found bug in the program.

However, such communication takes up more and more time that I could spend on improving the program.
In this regard, this process should be organized and systematized.
It is a reason why this document appears.


### THANKS

I created MetaProject for myself and for everyone who wants to use it.
Its creation took 4 years of my life, and became a part of me.
Therefore, problems with the product became my problems, and attitude towards the product became equal to attitude towards me.

Over the past year, I have met many wonderful people who, like me, want to make this product better.

I am grateful to everyone who is not indifferent, who wrote extensions to MetaProject, who offered great ideas,
who reported found bugs, who wrote positive reviews, and who simply supported me with a kind words.

Thanks to all!


### PROMOTION

I am very grateful to everyone who makes their contribution to improving the product.
There are such people, and I would like to highlight them.

For that people I created this [list](https://github.com/viacheslav-lozinskyi/MetaProject/blob/master/resource/community/Thanks.md).

At the moment, being in this list is just a demonstration of my gratitude.

In the future, MetaProject will be expanded with paid functionality.
It will be much more impressive than the current implementation.
And all people from the list will have it for free.


### RESTRICTIONS

There are people who come to communicate with claims.
They are all alike in that they don't see any advantages of MetaProject at all, but they see only disadvantages.
Even when only one of such disadvantage is found, or even it is invented.

They never say "thank you", but they always say that I owe them something.


It is a very "specific" gratitude...


There are very few such people, but communication with them eats up huge amount of my time.
That time which I could spend improving the product!


For such people, the answer will be next:

1. They will be automatically added to the [block list](https://bit.ly/metaproject-block)
2. For all users from the list, functionality of MetaProject will be restricted until the reason for entering block list is eliminated
3. I will not conduct any discussions with such people
4. I will answer by [email](mailto:viacheslav.lozinskyi@gmail.com) only when will see desire from other side to solve the problem


### RESOURCES

Due to that communication with users covers different topics, then for each topic there is the best place for communication:
